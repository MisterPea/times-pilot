--------------------------------------- Completed ---------------------------------------
* regex for password alternates between true and false once true is 
triggered and numbers are added at the end.

* Email regex test returns true before '.'

* Set route on rootSelection update.

* Bookmark and Add Topics need deactivation when not logged in.

* With the selections/navBar - have it at 100% height even without content - or add default content (Home)

* In section nav bar we need to have a minimum closeness. With flex we can get even spacing, 
but this is rendered moot if you have few sections chosen

* Get actual section names

* Modal Portal - innards too wide and causing horizontal scroll Bar

* Default image is image url is empty

------------------------------------------ Todo ------------------------------------------
* (Only on mobile) When a toggleSelector is pressed/de-pressed there is a slight flicker. 
It must be something in the action/down state style conflicting with the selected style.

* Swipe color (mobile) doesn't go under border radius

* Storybook: Toaster ref needs to be body or __next.

* News Sections Bar should have click and drag.

** Gradual load of images (stories) upon load/change page.

* Eye position on (show) password. It's set left because of autofill icon. Maybe we can detect that.

* Storybook - add password reset

* If rootSelection is empty, populate it with default Sections - add to db

** Default set screen on load - right now we show top bars then we hide them; let's try the opposite- hide them first then reveal.

* Section Selections in settings prevent the removal of all sections - a default to populate sections if empty might be a better solution.

* Potential, idiopathic race condition between account creation and allocating database space. It says it's a permission issue.

* Autosave - we need a minimum time deployed - and we might want to do a spinner. 

** 429 Popup / redirect - So when a rate limit happens we show a popup instead of redirecting.

* Mobile - Bookmark settings not clearing address bar on scroll

* Might be interesting to add hidden double-tap to delete bookmarks

* Mobile - stop scroll on swipe

* Empty space - Article Cards. There must be some elements left out of the calculation
