--------------------------------------- Completed ---------------------------------------
* regex for password alternates between true and false once true is 
triggered and numbers are added at the end.

* Email regex test returns true before '.'

* Set route on rootSelection update.

------------------------------------------ Todo ------------------------------------------
* (Only on mobile) When a toggleSelector is pressed/de-pressed there is a slight flicker. 
It must be something in the action/down state style conflicting with the selected style.

* Swipe color (mobile) doesn't go under border radius

* Storybook: Toaster ref needs to be body or __next.

* News Sections Bar should have click and drag.

* Gradual load of images (stories) upon load/change page.

* Eye position on (show) password. It's set left because of autofill icon. Maybe we can detect that.

* Modal Portal - innards too wide and causing horizontal scroll Bar

* Storybook - add password reset

* If rootSelection is empty, populate it with default Sections

* Get actual section names

* Default set screen on load - right now we show top bars then we hide them; let's try the opposite- hide them first then reveal.

* Section Selections in settings prevent the removal of all sections - a default to populate sections if empty might be a better solution.

* In section nav bar we need to have a minimum closeness. With flex we can get even spacing, 
but this is rendered moot if you have few sections chosen

* Potential, idiopathic race condition between account creation and allocating database space. It says it's a permission issue.

* Bookmark and Add Topics need deactivation when not logged in - maybe provide a link-copy-to-clipboard option.
